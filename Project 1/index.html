    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently working towards a degree in computer science at Oregon State University, alongside my existing degree in kinesiology. This dual educational background allows me to offer a unique blend of biomechanics and technology expertise. During my time as a student researcher at Oregon State University's FORCE Lab, I conducted research on insole design and performance, employing cutting-edge technology such as motion capture systems, force plates, and other tools to analyze data for renowned brands like Hoka and Adidas.

        My passion for sports and technology is further demonstrated through my role in sales and marketing at Sunnyside Sports, where I apply my technical knowledge to assist customers and organize community cycling events. In addition to my professional experiences, I have displayed leadership skills as the Director of Administrative Affairs for OSU's student government.
        
        While I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.Sc. in Kinesiology in 2022, my primary focus now is on pursuing my computer science degree at OSU. Proficient in various software, including Microsoft Office, Canva, and specialized biomechanics programs, I am excited to leverage my diverse background in a role that intersects sports, technology, and research.
